# High performance Image Gallery

## General

This task is performance oriented. It is framework agnostic and does not require you to implement 
complex user interfaces. However, you will need to show both problem solving skill and extensive knowledge in frontend development topics.  
     
## Task
Implement an image gallery. 

## Requirements
1. Look and feel blazing fast on both mobile and desktop
2. Scalable (support extremely high amount of images)
3. Responsive (all images should have the same fixed height but it should *NOT* hardcoded)
5. Scroll bars should represent the expected height of the page and move respond well to scrolling

### Helpful information
1. Images have 1:1 ratio
2. JSON contain images with multiple quality versions and a prominent color

### BONUSES!

* Make the gallery available offline! (HINT: Use your previous bonus)
* MEGA BONUS: Make it work on IE8 (not really :P)


# GOOD LUCK :D
